# PythonHTTPServer

Simplest HTTP Server. Just clone this repo and navigate to that folder and run main.py:

```console
git clone https://github.com/AliiAhmadi/PythonHTTPServer.git
```
 Now:
 
 ```console
 cd PythonHTTPServer
 ```
 
 At last:
 
```console
python3 main.py
```

You can improve that and make more classes and methods to be responsible to every HTTP requests.
